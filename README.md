# TTT task details
Develop a frontend in Reactjs or Nextjs, which does the following:

1. On first load, only has a Submit button
2. On clicking on Submit, it will fetch the contents of terriblytinytales.com/test.txt
3. Parse the content and find the frequency of occurrence of each word (some words will occur only once, some twice and so on, and some will occur N times)
4. Then on the frontend, plot a histogram of the 20 most occurring words.

X-axis = top 20 words with highest occurrence
Y-axis = how many times they occurred in the file

Expected solution:
1. The source code should be uploaded to github along with a readme file. Readme must explain components of the code and mention all libraries and plugins used.

2. Extra points for hosting this solution on Heroku/Netlify or somewhere online.

Extra work done by me
1. Choosing any local text file for plotting the histogram. (uncomment line 74 in App.js in src folder and then run it)
